## Patient Appointment Management Database


### **About The Project**
This is a database created for a fictional medical practice used to manage patient appointment information. This was created as part of a college database project where information was given describing a paper based system currently used by the medical practice. The purpose of the project was to design a databae to replace their paper system and to migrate their data to the new system. The database was designed using relational database principles. For this project I used XAMPP and phpMyAdmin to locally-host the database while building it.

- Stores information on Patients, Appointments, Consultants, Staff, Procedure Pricing, Bills, Payments
- Database Designed With Views To Present Frequently Needed Information (e.g This Weeks Appointments)
